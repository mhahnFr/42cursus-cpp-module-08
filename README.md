## Welcome to 42cursus-cpp-module-08!
This is the ninth project featuring C++ at the [42 school]. It is the last part of the C++ crash course.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to have a deep look into the standard containers of C++.

- In the first exercise one uses a simple standard function to find a specific element in a container.
- The second exercise features a small wrapper class, which can store a variable count of Integer elements.
It is also able to find the biggest difference between the stored elements as well as the lowest difference.
- The third exercise features a wrapper around the ``std::stack`` in order to add the iterators to it.
